This app was written to make a very specific and very tedious process fast and simple.

## Existing Manual Process
1. PDFs are collected into folders.
2. Each folder's PDFs are manually combined into a single PDF file inside that folder
3. All combined PDFs are then manually combined into a single "master" PDF file 

## App Functionality

This app allows users to select the folders that contain the individual PDFs to be combined, and specify a "master" file name. The app will go into each of the selected folders,
combine the PDFs into a new PDF named after the folder its contained in. Then it will take all of the newly created PDFs and combine them into a single "master" PDF with the 
user input name, and place that in the same directory as the selected folders.
